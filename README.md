# PlanEase

Ever since UBC's transition from SSC to Workday, students have had many issues with the scheduling of courses. Since 
Workday is an employee-centric rather than a student-centric application, the scheduling functions provided by the 
website are unintuitive, slow and overwhelming. 

With PlanEase, we intend to create a website for students of all backgrounds where they can browse courses, create
potential schedules, and plan their ideal academic years.  



## User-Stories
